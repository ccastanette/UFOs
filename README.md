# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to create a website that will allow us to filter a table of UFO sighting data on multiple criteria, quickly and cleanly. We need to use the existing data that was provided and pull it into the site in a table format then filter it from there.

## Results

The results were a neat and clean site that will allow us to filter the UFO sighting data on 5 different criteria: Date, City, State, Country, Shape of sighting. The site consists of 3 main components:

The headers and a short paragraph explaining the purpose of the site:

The table of all of our collected UFO sighting data:

And the filters we created:

To use the filters we only need to enter a value and hit enter. If the results are still too broad you can simply enter a value in another call and hit enter again. This will filter the already filtered results even more. For example the results below are filtered to only include light shaped sightings in California.

## Summary

For the most part the results we got are useful, easy to read, and understand. One drawback of the site is that it only includes data that we already have on hand. I would recommend making a way for users to add their own sighting data that can then be researched and added to the main table. The table is also fairly plain. I would recommend adding pictured of the sighting if they are available and possibly a forum for users to comment on sightings or just chat in general.
